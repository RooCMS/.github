# Contributing to RooCMS üöÄ

Thanks for your interest in contributing to RooCMS! This document outlines the process and standards for contributing to the project.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `dev`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. **Follow the coding standards** (described below)
4. **Write tests** if necessary
5. **Submit a pull request** to the `dev` branch

## Bug Reporting

If you found a bug, please follow these steps:

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/roocms/roocms/issues)
2. Create a new issue with a detailed description:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - PHP version, web server, OS
   - Error logs (if any)

## Feature Proposals

For new features:
1. Create an issue with a description of the proposal
2. Discuss the approach with the project team
3. Implement only after approval

## Coding Standards

### PHP
- **PHP 8.1+** - code must be compatible with PHP 8.1 and above
- **Strict typing** - use type declarations for parameters and return values
- **Modern syntax** - use match expressions, nullsafe operator, constructor property promotion
- **Naming**:
  - snake_case for functions, methods, variables, and arrays
  - CamelCase for classes, controllers, etc.
- **No frameworks** - only pure PHP
- **No ORM** - use direct SQL queries via Db class (PDO)

### Architecture
- **Custom MVC** - implement the MVC pattern from scratch
- **Dependencies** - manage dependencies via the DependencyContainer class
- **Autoloading** - use custom autoloading or simple require/include

### Frontend
*These standards apply to the frontend code of RooCMS directly in the development project.
End users can use any frameworks and build tools at their discretion.*
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **JavaScript**: Alpine.js 3.x (CSP compatible)
- **No frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular - prohibited
- **No build tools**: webpack, Vite - prohibited
- **CSP compatibility**: use CSP nonce

### Database
- **Direct SQL queries** - with Db class (PDO)
- **DbConnect class** - for database connections
- **Migration** - use the migration system for schema changes
