# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of creating an open and welcoming environment, we, as participants and maintainers of the RooCMS project, commit ourselves to making participation in our project and community free from harassment for everyone, regardless of body size, disability, ethnic origin, self-expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, physical appearance, race, or religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Use welcoming language
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
* Constructive criticism and accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Posting personal information about others, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
* Behavior that could lead to the discomfort or humiliation of other community members.
* Behavior that contradicts principles of morality and ethics.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any participant for other behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, abusive, or harmful.

## Our Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using the official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Violation

Cases of offensive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [support@roocms.com](mailto:support@roocms.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be published separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as defined by other members of the project leadership.
